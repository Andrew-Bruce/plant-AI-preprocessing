Used as on part of my high school project where I tried to automate the entire agriculture industry.
The code is very bad because it was made by someone in high school.

The plan was to have 2 cameras spaced a few inches apart on a robot to take a picture of a plant, use the 2 images to build a 3d depth map, then cut up the image into the individual plants which would then be given to a python Tensorflow AI. The AI would detect if it was a weed or not. Then the robot would have an arm or sprayer or something that could target the weed or plant to either pick it, spray fertelizer, water it, using the 3d spacial data.

This program is just to calculate the depth data and cut up the images into individual plants which would then be given to the AI, this is not the actual AI.
It also does not work very well.
